# Cafe App UI

[Project description: Web App which helps cafe franchise owner to manage cafes and employees who work in cafes]

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js and npm**: You will need Node.js to run the project and npm to manage project dependencies. Check if you have Node.js and npm installed by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal. If you don't have Node.js installed, download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

- **Git**: To clone the repository, Git needs to be installed. If not, you can download the zip version directly from the repository page.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone [Repository_URL]
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd cafe-app-ui
    ```

3. **Install project dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Project Locally

After setting up everything, follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Create .env file within project folder**:
   Key in the .env file key-value pairs shared by project owner

2. **Start the development server** (Note: we are starting the frontend on port 3001 because the backend is expected to run on port 3000):

    ```bash
    PORT=3001 npm start
    ```

After executing the command, the React development server will start, and the application should open in a new browser window. If it doesn't, manually navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
